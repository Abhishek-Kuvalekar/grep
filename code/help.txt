Usage: grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...
Search for PATTERN in each FILE.
PATTERN is, by default, a basic regular expression (BRE).
Example: grep -i hello menu.h main.c

Regexp selection and interpretation:
  -G         PATTERN is a basic regular expression (BRE).
  -i         Ignore case distinctions in both the pattern and input files. 
  -w         Force PATTERN to match only whole words.
  -x         Force PATTERN to match only whole lines.
  -v         Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.
  -y         Obsolete synonym for -i.

Miscellaneous:
  --help     Display this help text and exit.

Output control:
  -m NUM     Stop reading a file after NUM matches.
  -n         Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number within 
             its input file.
  -o         Print only the matched parts of a matching line. 
  -r         Read all files under each directory, recursively. Note that, multiple 
             directories can be given(maximum 16) on command line.
  -c         Suppress  normal output; instead print a count of matching lines
             for each input file. With the -v option, count non-matching lines.
  -l         Suppress  normal  output; instead print the name of each input file from 
             which output would normally have been printed. The scanning will stop on the first match.
  -L         Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from 
             which no output would normally have been printed. The scanning will stop on the first match.
  -h         Suppress the prefixing of file names on output. This is the default when 
             there is only one file (or only standard input) to search.
  -H         Print the file name for each match. This is the default when there is more than one file to search.
