Hello guys. My name is Abhishek. I am a student in COEP.
COEP is cool. It is student-oriented.
I study data structures.
I love linux kernel. A student developed it in 1991.
Are you a student? If not then you must be the teacher. What do you say about my project?
Students are busy in their DSA project.
Student from Alabama is my friend.
She said there are lot of opportunities for students of National Student Association.
I liked that student oriented system.
I gotta go. Bye bye. See you stud.
